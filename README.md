# Learn Next.js - Create a Blog

This is using [pages], rather than [app] structure. 

This project was started from scratch rather than using the create react app.


## Get Started

``npm install``

``npm run dev``

## Learning Notes

**Add Pages**

* Pages folder > any .js file in here, is a page.
* File based system router


Client side navigation is faster. 
The next router is using client side navigation.

__app.js file is rendered first.
